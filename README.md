### Visualisation Walk-through
In this walk-through, users are guided by sections.

In the first section, Australian Wine Overview, users can hover over the bar charts to check the values, number of wineries and average ratings for each Australian state.

In the second section, Victorian Wine Regions Inspection, please have a close reading at the data visualisation playground rules and it will help you explore the visualisations in the next section.

In the third section, Victorian Wine Data Visualisation Playground, users can start with a looking-around by hovering over each graph to check out Victorian wine data. 

The VicWine Data Visualisation Playground is composed of four interactive brushing and linking visualisations. They drill down into details from the state level (Victoria) to wine regions then to wineries. Please note that if you want to go back to Victoria after selecting a wine region, the only action you can do is to refresh the page.
